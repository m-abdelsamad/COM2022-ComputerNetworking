# Computer Networking (COM2022) CW

This repository contains the files that I have tested with my team, and the extensions put into a separate folder 'Potential Extensions'

For this section I used an encryption library provided by RSA. 
To be able to run the code, please do:

```bash
pip install pycrypto
```
before running both the client and the server
